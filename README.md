# OutsideLive

Start a silent disco or party broadcast and stream directly to user's phones and/or sound equipment. 

A musician will create an event which will provide him with an IP address to connect to his musical equipment 
and be able to broadcast to users who sign on into the event. 

Inspired by trying to create an easier way to create a Silent Disco for free.
